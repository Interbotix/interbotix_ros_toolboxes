# Each node in this YAML file represents a single landmark.
# The format of a single landmark's configuration is as follows:
# ID:
#   id: ID
#   label: LABEL
#   mounted: MOUNTED
#   mounted_offset: MOUNTED_OFFSET
#   set: SET
# ID (int) - the AprilTag ID corresponding to the landmark
# LABEL (str) - a human-readable name
# MOUNTED (bool) - `true` if the landmark's AprilTag is mounted to a vertical surface, `false` if
#   on the floor
# MOUNTED_OFFSET (float) - if mounted, distance normal to the tag the robot should navigate to
# SET (bool) - whether or not the robot has seen and set a transform to the landmark
