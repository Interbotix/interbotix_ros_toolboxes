# interbotix_gravity_compensation

## Overview

This package contains the C++ implementation of the gravity compensation features of a common robotic arm.

## Gravity Compensation

### Introduction

As its name suggests, gravity compensation cancels out the effect of the gravity on a system.
In our case, we compensate the gravity on a robotic arm with its joint motors.
This feature is useful when we use the arm as a teleoperation remote or when we teach it a specific trajectory and don't want to keep holding the arm to avoid it from collapsing.

### Formal Formulation

Computing the torques needed to compensate for the gravity is a special case of the [inverse dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_dynamics) problem where the gravity is the only external force.
More specifically, one is interested in finding the following mapping

```math
\tau=\text{ID}(\text{model}, \mathbf{q}, \dot{\mathbf{q}}, \ddot{\mathbf{q}})
```

where $\text{model}$ specifies the inertia of the system and the forces applied to it, $\mathbf{q}$, $\dot{\mathbf{q}}$, and $\ddot{\mathbf{q}}\in\Bbb{R}^6$ are the joint positions, velocities, and accelerations.

One way to solve the inverse dynamics problem is the *recursive Newton-Euler algorithm*.
It consists three steps
1. Compute the velocities and accelerations of the links
2. Compute the forces required to produce such motions, i.e., fictitious forces
3. Compute the forces acting upon the links

Step 1: the velocity and acceleration of the $i$'th link $\mathbf{v}_i, \mathbf{a}_i\in\Bbb{S}$ are given by the following recursive relations associated with the angular velocity and acceleration of the $i$'th joint $\dot{q}_i, \ddot{q}_i\in\Bbb{R}$, and the $i$'th joint axis $\mathbf{s}_i\in\Bbb{S}$, where $\Bbb{S}$ is the set of [screws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_theory).
Note that $\mathbf{s}_i$ is determined by the current joint positions $\mathbf{q}$ through [forward kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_kinematics).

```math
\mathbf{v}_{i+1}=\mathbf{v}_{i}+\mathbf{s}_i\dot{q}_i\text{ with }\mathbf{v}_0=\mathbf{0}
```

```math
\mathbf{a}_{i+1}=\mathbf{a}_{i}+\mathbf{s}_i\ddot{q}_i+\dot{\mathbf{s}}_i\dot{q}_i\text{ with }\mathbf{a}_0=\mathbf{0}
```

Step 2: the fictitious force $\mathbf{f}^B_i\in\Bbb{S}$ is associated with the inertia $\mathbf{I}_i\in\Bbb{R}^{6\times6}$, velocity $\mathbf{v}_i$, and accelerations $\mathbf{a}_i$ of the $i$'th link.

```math
\mathbf{f}^B_i=\mathbf{I}_i\cdot\mathbf{a}_i+\mathbf{v}_i\times(\mathbf{I}_i\cdot\mathbf{v}_i)
```

Step 3: the forces acting on the $i$'th link should balance. $\mathbf{f}_{i}\in\Bbb{S}$ is the force applied through the $i$'th joint to the $i+1$'th link and $\mathbf{f}^x_i\in\Bbb{S}$ is the net external force acting on the $i$'th link.

```math
\mathbf{f}^B_i=\mathbf{f}_{i-1}+\mathbf{f}^x_i-\mathbf{f}_{i}
```

The resulting torque of the $i$'th joint is given by

```math
\tau_i=\mathbf{s}_i\cdot\mathbf{f}_{i}
```

The inverse dynamics solver used in the package is ported from the [Orocos Kinematics and Dynamics Library (KDL)](https://www.orocos.org/kdl.html).
Please refer to the KDL doc page for its [derivations](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4899-7560-7) and [implementation](https://docs.ros.org/en/indigo/api/orocos_kdl/html/classKDL_1_1ChainIdSolver__RNE.html) details.

## Motor Assistance

The joint frictions cause two problems

1. The kinetic friction resists the joint from moving.
2. The disparity between the kinetic friction and the static friction causes [stiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiction).

Making things worse, the frictions at the joints are mapped to a resisting wrench at the end effector by the force Jacobian matrix. Depending on the joint positions of the arm, the resulting wrench may become infinitely large.

We address this issue by using the motors to counteract the frictions proactively.

### Kinetic Friction

When a joint is moving, we add a assisting torque towards the direction of the motion.
We use the coulomb friction model where the friction force is proportional to the total normal force acting on the contact surface.
And we simplify the nominal wrench transmitted through the joint into two parts

1. A torque about the joint axis.
2. A constant wrench accounting for other forces and torques.

As a result, the kinetic friction torque about the joint axis is given by

```math
\tau_k = \mu_k\tau+c
```

where $\tau_k$ is the kinetic friction torque, $\tau$ is the nominal torque transmitted through the joint, $\mu_k$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction associated with the torque (i.e., `kinetic_friction_coefficient`), $c$ accounts for the friction torque caused by other forces and torques (i.e., `no_load_current`).

### Stiction

We add a dither to each joint when it is moving below a specified speed (i.e., `dither_speed`) to avoid stiction. It periodically pushes the joint in alternating directions so that the joint is moving for the majority of time.
The dithering frequency is half of the publishing rate of the `/<namespace>/joint_states` topic.
The dithering magnitude dither matches that of the static friction torque, given by

```math
\tau_s = \mu_s\tau
```

where $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction associated with the torque (i.e., `static_friction_coefficient`).

**WARNING: excessive dithering WILL cause heat and wear on the joints**

## Structure

### Publisher

- `joint_group_pub_`: publishes the desired current commands to the `/<namespace>/commands/joint_group` topic for the robotic arm to execute.

### Subscription

- `joint_state_sub_`: subscribes to the `/<namespace>/joint_states` topic.
When a new message arrives, it does nothing if the `gravity_compensation_enabled_` flag is set false.
Otherwise, it solves for the torques required to counteract the gravity, i.e., inverse dynamics.
Then, it adds padding torques depending on the directions of joint movements to ease the kinetic frictions and dithering torques to eliminate stiction.
Finally, it converts the resulting torques into motor current commands and publishes it via `joint_group_pub_`.

### Service

- `gravity_compensation_enable_srv_`: hosts a service to conveniently enable/disable the gravity compensation feature.
When a enable request is received, it sets the operating mode of all joints to the "current" mode.
Then, it torques on the joints which support the "current" mode and torques off the others. It sets the `gravity_compensation_enabled_` flag to true at the end.
When a disable request is received, it set the `gravity_compensation_enabled_` flag to false. Then, it sets the "arm" joint group to the "position" mode and the "gripper" joint to the "current_based_position" mode.
Finally, it torques on all joints.
All aforementioned operations are done via service calls to the `xs_sdk` node.

### Client

- `robot_info_client_`: client of the `/<namespace>/get_robot_info` service.
- `operating_modes_client_`: client of the `/<namespace>/set_operating_modes` service.
- `torque_enable_client_`: client of the `/<namespace>/torque_enable` service.

### Misc

- `load_motor_specs(...)`: loads the motor specs from a `motor_specs.yaml`, sets the motor specs vectors, and scales the kinetic friction coefficients and the no-load-currents based on the motor assist settings.
- `get_joint_names()`: gets the vector of joint names via the `robot_info_client_` and set the number of joints in the "arm" joint group.
- `set_operating_modes(...)`: sets the operating mode of a joint or a group of joints via the `operating_modes_client_`.
- `torque_enable(...)`: enables or disables torque on a joint or a group of joints via the `torque_enable_client_`.
- `prepare_tree()`: loads the "robot_description" parameter from the `/<namespace>/robot_state_publisher` node and parse it into a KDL [tree](https://docs.ros.org/en/indigo/api/orocos_kdl/html/classKDL_1_1Tree.html) object used by the inverse dynamics solver.

## Configuration

The `motor_specs.yaml` hosts the motor specifications used in the node and provides knobs for motor assistance against joint frictions.
A template file is given below
```yaml

# If the values are invalid, they default to 0
# Joints not specified in the motor_assist or motor_specs sections
# do not support the current control mode

  # Set 'all' to [0, 1] to scale the no load currents of all joints uniformly
  # Or to -1 and use joint specific values
